				<h2>Team Profile - Goony</h2>
			</br>
				<h3> Andrew Chen - s3656093 </h3>
					<p>Andrew’s 16 Personalities test results came up as an “Advocate”, he is extremely unique as advocate’s only make up less than 1% of the
					population. A common attribute of this is being an introvert. Andrew will be good at making decisions, inspiring and being creative.
					Loyalty is important to him, if the teams he works with contribute their part, Andrew will happily work with his team. Andrew works well in
					the backline as long as there is a strong group leader. Weaknesses that can be seen with Andrew are that he can be sensitive and private.
					Andrew should be mindful of his weaknesses and ensure that he opens up to the team when he is in need of a hand as his team have great
					teamwork traits. </p>
			 	</br>

			 	<h3> Belle Dungca - s3872298 </h3>
					<p> The 16 Personality test results of Belle display that she is driven, passionate and has great communication skills. These are a trait
					of a “Mediator”. Some weaknesses of a Mediator are being too realistic and stretching yourself too thin to cater for others. The weaknesses
					presentation may not be accurate but should still be monitored to ensure conflict can be avoided. Belle finds that she gets well involved
					in a group project and targets getting work done early to stay ahead of schedule. She has good skills in delegating tasks, listening to
					others opinions and ensuring balance in teams. </p>
				</br>

				<h3> Benjamin Bullock - s3872298 </h3>
					<p> Tests conducted by Ben included the 16 Personalities, Education Planner and Creativity Test. These tests reflect on Ben’s judgement and
					behaviour around others. The aim of these tests is to discover Ben’s best suited position in the group. A great trait of Ben is that he
					finds the best suited conclusion for all parties and believes in fairness amongst peers. His creativity test showed that he mainly has a
					curious and complex mindset. Ben is seen to be a great listener but can leave this zone and voice valuable opinions. With Ben’s useful
					creativity, the group has agreed to use his project idea as it is unique and achievable. </p>
				</br>

				<h3> Campbell Bennett - s3841068 </h3>
				<p> The personality test performed by Campbell indicates that he is introverted, sensing, thinking and perceiving. Campbell agrees with this
					test as he sees himself as an introverted but once he gets to know others and becomes more comfortable, he opens up to be much more outgoing.
					This means Campbell will likely be more of an observer at the start of the team project but overtime will contribute more willingly. Campbell’s
					learning style is displayed as part auditory learner, visual learner and tactile learner. This means it is expected that he will easily pick
					up information in any context and can adapt to different situations. This is a great attribute to have in the team. Finally, Campbell’s
					creativity test displayed a score of 37.95, although less than average, this does not mean his skills are not useful. He should focus on
					building the ideas of teammates rather than creating his own. </p>
				</br>

				<h3> Tom Barber - s3872290 </h3>
				<p> The test results completed by Tom indicates that he has introverted, intuitive, thinking, and prospecting personality traits. He is
						better as a visual learner and has a standard level of creativity. Positive traits that are likely to come out of Tom include analytical
						thinking, open-mindedness and objectivity; whereas my weaknesses include absent-mindedness, insularity and second-guessing. Tom is aware
						of what he must consider when working with a team. He will prioritise listening to others and valuing their input by taking notes. Tom
						will have some great thoughts and suggestions that he should confidently voice out when appropriate. </p>
				</br>

				<h3> Tung Nguyen - s3871942 </h3>
					<p>The “Adventurer” personality that Tung has suggests that he is creative and likes to change traditional barriers and social norms. With this,
					Tung actively engages in opportunities to learn new skills but can quickly become bored and lose interest. Adventurer’s do not like to be
					micromanaged and prefer the unconventional method of doing things. Tung’s ability to work in teams is great especially when the team
					understands his way of doing things. Tung also prefers visual learning and matches his creative personality. As long as the group has trust
					in Tung and allows for his own method of work, he is a great asset to the team. </p>
