							<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
							<div>
								<p>Cybersecurity is at the frontlines of protecting personal and professional assets in a modern and dynamic world of cloud storage, online banking and network solutions. There are many different applications for cybersecurity and it is an ever changing and highly sought after position by businesses in the information technology industry.</p>
								<p>Norton states the applications of cybersecurity at the moment are (Norton p3): 
									<ul>
										<li>Critical infrastructure security</li>
										<li>Network security</li>
										<li>Application security</li>
										<li>Information security</li>
										<li>Cloud security</li>
										<li>Data loss prevention</li>
										<li>End-user education</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p> Norton also provides a list of different types of cyber threats that can occur (Norton p3):
									<ul>
										<li>Preventing social engineering, APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)</li>
										<li>Preventing malware</li>
										<li>Preventing ransomware</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>The different types of attacks that can occur are attacks on confidentiality, attacks on integrity and attacks on availability. Attacks on confidentiality are designed to take personal information about a customer or client in order to sell the information elsewhere. Attacks on integrity are when information is stolen about a business and leaked online. Finally, attacks on availability are normally when an unauthorized user accesses a network and uses ransomware to lock out parts of a business and demands a payment from a business for the hacker to unlock those areas of the network that the business requires to operate normally (Norton).</p>
								<p>Cybersecurity is a pretty exciting industry in terms of what are the possibilities of this technology. With the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and machine learning this leads to exciting new possibilities with cybersecurity, like including an adaptive AI into the protection of your network and assets is a good way of staying on top of network threats. This artificial intelligence would have to be able to effectively predict where network threats are likely to occur, as well as comb through business data to look for infectious and nefarious programs and remove them like a white blood cell would remove a virus from your body.</p>
								<p>Implementing this technology into cybersecurity can certainly help, and to some extent has already been implemented in the defence of networks. According to an article Trusting artificial intelligence in cybersecurity is a double-edged sword 2019 artificial intelligence and machine learning are already being used to defeat attacks autonomously, generate strategies for the attack in the future and even generate decoys and create honeypots for attackers to steal instead of actual any business IP that would be detrimental to a business’s unique assets. However, from the same article, it’s also shown that an AI that is used to protect a business from cyber attacks can actually be repurposed to steal information and poison data streams. If done correctly by an attacker, this can be very difficult to discover due to artificial intelligence programs sometimes lacking transparency (Taddeo, McCutcheon & Floridi 2019).</p>
								<p>Like most aspects of information technology and engineering, automation of cybersecurity is a very likely possibility for the future of this technology. A key aspect of this will be the ever evolving abilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The main issue that employees tasked with protecting a network face is the volume of attacks that a business might face daily, and this can become overwhelming for one or even many people trying to constantly defend against these automated attacks. The detection of threats before they happen will be the future of cybersecurity especially threats that haven’t actually happened yet.</p>
								<p>The impacts of implementing AI and machine learning into cybersecurity to automate some aspects are pretty substantial in terms of minimising human effort. The amount of effort required for a network security department to manually skim through network logs and alerts could be manageable if they didn’t have very much in the way of network infrastructure, but when you get to huge companies like google, amazon or even military grade networks it would almost be impossible to stop all the cyber attacks that occur manually. In addition to this, the tolerance for discovering a possible threat and then trying to stop the attack before it was complete would be very small. Most of the time, if a new kind of cyber attack was discovered it might be after the attack has already successfully occurred, leading to the business having to invest their time into damage control to try and discover what data was stolen or what the ramifications of this breach could mean for their company.</p>
								<p>The market for cybersecurity is growing rapidly, a post by Forbes estimates that the current cybersecurity market is worth “173B in 2020” and suggests that it might grow “to 270B by 2026” (Columbus p9 2020). In addition to this, the U.S bureau of statistics estimates that the job market for positions such as information security analysts will increase by 31% between 2019 to 2029 while SEEK estimates job growth of 18% for the same position over the next five years. From these statistics, it’s clear to see that the cybersecurity industry is growing rapidly and will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, an information security analyst is only one kind job in the cybersecurity industry; other types of jobs in cybersecurity can be  programming, infrastructure, security engineers and much more.</p>
								<p>The effects that cybersecurity will have on an everyday user’s life are huge and are felt almost every day and it’s becoming easier for an everyday user to implement cybersecurity into their lives. The ramifications of cyber attacks for an end user could be devastating to their lives, whether that is a personal information leaked for public viewing or their personal data is stolen and used by someone else.This is also true if a user were to access a network that doesn’t have adequate network security or entrust their personal details to a business that doesn’t protect their assets well enough, or are ethically compromised and sell customer data to ad companies for profit could lead to some serious consequences for a user in the future.</p>
								<p>The reason why I’m so focused on the end-user in this context is because they are everyday people like me that are trying to make it in this ever changing world of the internet and being constantly connected to some sort of network. Luckily for the end-users, there are always ways that you can protect yourself and your privacy while browsing the internet and connecting to networks. Simple methods such as: not clicking on strange links or opening foregin emails, using strong passwords that include a mixture of numbers, lower and upper case letters and symbols, using two-factor authentication, avoiding using unsecure wifis and using virtual private networks can all be ways an end-user like RMIT students can employ simple network security methods to keep online browsing safe.</p>
								<p>With services and businesses quickly going online, it is so important for an end-user like myself and my family to protect themselves online from malicious and nefarious cyber attacks that prey on the naivety of users. In addition to this, it is crucially important that when an end-user can’t control the level of cybersecurity used, like when they access everyday services such as online banking, the security of the end-users that use the product or service is held to high regard by the company, because many people put their trust in a service to deliver a safe and stress free experience for their customers.</p>

							<h2>Machine Learning</h2>

								<p>Machine learning is the ability for computer systems to extrapolate unordered or labelled data on it’s own to develop algorithms and processes to complete tasks more efficiently and effectively. In a ZDNet post about machine learning, Nick Heath describes the difference between “traditional computer software is that a human developer hasn’t written code that instructs the system how to tell the difference between the banana and the apple. Instead a machine-learning model has been taught how to reliably discriminate between the fruits by being trained on a large amount of data.”(Heath p6 2020) . The main takeaway from the statement is that machine learning is like trying to teach someone something new, it just requires a lot of information and repetition but eventually it will become ingrained within the person’s brain.</p>
								<p>Big data companies such as google and facebook are really demonstrating what is state-of-the-art for machine learning. The scope of google's implementation of machine learning into all of their products is pretty astounding. Machine learning is in google products such as Gmail, google maps, google search, the google assistant, google translate and much more of their products. An important aspect of google's service is that they wish to provide a fast and robust system that reacts quickly to changing trends and information. Google maps is a remarkably fast way of gauging how long it will take to reach a destination and understanding the possible delays in real-time for the user's journey.</p>
								<p>There are many applications of machine learning that are in use today, some of them include: 
									<ul>
										<li>Online shopping websites like amazon recommending products</li>
										<li>Streaming services recommending what to watch based of previous items streamed</li>
										<li>Google and facebook recommending ads based of search history</li>
										<li>Outlook recognizing and removing suspicious emails from your inbox</li>
										<li>Predictive text trying to predict what word you are going to need next or what phrase you are about to type out</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>The main technology that will be focused on in this report is autonomous vehicles. A post from the IIoT World explains “one of the main tasks of any machine learning algorithm in the self-driving car is a continuous rendering of the surrounding environment and the prediction of the possible changes to those surroundings” (Anil Gupta p2 2018). The challenge of this is developing a computer system that will be able to compute all the data coming in from all of the sensors, cameras and radars needed to visualise the surroundings into a logical and accurate prediction of what could happen.</p>
								<p>The use of deep learning to improve on machine learning will be a vital component to make autonomous vehicles. Deep learning is a subclass of machine learning and it’s when a deep neural network is developed for a computer system so that it can improve on its own accord without the need of human intervention. The more data and scenarios that a network of autonomous vehicles can be introduced to, the more likely it will be that the autonomous vehicle will be able to act in a way that will simulate a real driver.</p>
								<p>Some of the other applications of deep learning are (MathWorks p3):
									<ul>
										<li>Virtual assistants</li>
										<li>Medical research</li>
										<li>Hearing and speech recognition</li>
										<li>WorkSafe to ensure the safety of workers around automated machinery</li>
										<li>Aerospace and Defence</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>The impact of this development is limitless and incredibly exciting in terms of the technology advancements that are possible by utilizing a deep neural network (DNN) for new technologies like autonomous vehicles, medical imaging and virtual assistants. Although, these new technological advancements don’t come without its own issues.</p>
								<p>Some likely changes that will be seen with DNNs are that they are built with many different layers of algorithms which result in complex software architecture. “An explanation for a certain decision made by a DNN cannot be retrieved by simply scrutinizing the inference process” (Ras, Gerven, Haselager p5 2018) this demonstrates that as a DNN are created with more and more layers and have a more complex architecture, this will mean that the source of the decisions made by the DNN will become more and more ambiguous. This change to independent learning for machine learning will lead to some difficulty in debugging decisions if the network picks up on trends that are socially or ethically inappropriate.</p>
								<p>While there are some setbacks to DNNs there are still positives to them also. If self driving cars become commonplace on the roads in the near future, the ability for people who weren’t able to drive in cars previously might be able to live a more independent life using this new technology. In addition to this, other deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) which is a type of network that is designed to analyze images will be implemented into the medical industry to process MRI results or x-rays. Studies are also starting to show that “some CNNs are approaching - or even surpassing - the accuracy of human diagnosticians when identifying important  features in diagnostic imaging studies” (Bresnick, J. p29 2018). This demonstrates that the potential for the uses of neural networks are not just limited to one industry and has the potential to help people across most industries that require the extrapolation of data.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately machine learning is key in the production of artificial intelligence and automation, which is certainly the way the world is going and that means that there will definitely be jobs that may no longer exist in the future. There is a high possibility that all data input and analysis jobs will all become more efficient and effective with machine learning instead of humans, so there is the possibility that whole industries will no longer support human jobs for those roles.</p>
								<p>Machine learning is already prevalent in today’s society so it is already affecting everyone in their daily lives. We all have access to google services and facebook which in many aspects is run by machine learning. All of your search history and cookies are being collected by these companies and made into context for their advertisements that will be constantly viewed and clicked on by their users. These advertisements are crucially important for companies to get revenue so they will try to put them in view for their users.</p>
								<p>This is important because it changes your ability to manage your privacy if you decide to use these services. If all of your data is constantly being collected by these companies it can leave your personal information in a position that you wouldn’t be able to control the distribution of this information. This can lead to your data being vulnerable to hackers and company data breaches. Of course, it’s not all bad outcomes from machine learning and it can be used to improve a user’s experience through providing sophisticated image and data processing neural networks to allow real-time updates about a planned journey in google maps. Finally, machine learning and deep learning is an interesting topic and is still a new technology with huge potential. These technologies have the potential to improve the predictive capabilities of many businesses and services. It’s crucial that the users like myself, my friends and family aren’t left behind in terms of the transparency of these technologies. It’s a slippery slope if the user's privacy is neglected so that the services that we use can exploit our personal data so they can get more revenue through ads or analytics.</p>
