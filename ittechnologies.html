							<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
							<div>
								<p>Cybersecurity is at the frontlines of protecting personal and professional assets in a modern and dynamic world of cloud storage, online banking and network solutions. There are many different applications for cybersecurity and it is an ever changing and highly sought after position by businesses in the information technology industry.</p>
								<p>Norton states the applications of cybersecurity at the moment are (Norton p3): 
									<ul>
										<li>Critical infrastructure security</li>
										<li>Network security</li>
										<li>Application security</li>
										<li>Information security</li>
										<li>Cloud security</li>
										<li>Data loss prevention</li>
										<li>End-user education</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p> Norton also provides a list of different types of cyber threats that can occur (Norton p3):
									<ul>
										<li>Preventing social engineering, APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)</li>
										<li>Preventing malware</li>
										<li>Preventing ransomware</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>The different types of attacks that can occur are attacks on confidentiality, attacks on integrity and attacks on availability. Attacks on confidentiality are designed to take personal information about a customer or client in order to sell the information elsewhere. Attacks on integrity are when information is stolen about a business and leaked online. Finally, attacks on availability are normally when an unauthorized user accesses a network and uses ransomware to lock out parts of a business and demands a payment from a business for the hacker to unlock those areas of the network that the business requires to operate normally (Norton).</p>
								<p>Cybersecurity is a pretty exciting industry in terms of what are the possibilities of this technology. With the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and machine learning this leads to exciting new possibilities with cybersecurity, like including an adaptive AI into the protection of your network and assets is a good way of staying on top of network threats. This artificial intelligence would have to be able to effectively predict where network threats are likely to occur, as well as comb through business data to look for infectious and nefarious programs and remove them like a white blood cell would remove a virus from your body.</p>
								<p>Implementing this technology into cybersecurity can certainly help, and to some extent has already been implemented in the defence of networks. According to an article Trusting artificial intelligence in cybersecurity is a double-edged sword 2019 artificial intelligence and machine learning are already being used to defeat attacks autonomously, generate strategies for the attack in the future and even generate decoys and create honeypots for attackers to steal instead of actual any business IP that would be detrimental to a business’s unique assets. However, from the same article, it’s also shown that an AI that is used to protect a business from cyber attacks can actually be repurposed to steal information and poison data streams. If done correctly by an attacker, this can be very difficult to discover due to artificial intelligence programs sometimes lacking transparency (Taddeo, McCutcheon & Floridi 2019).</p>
								<p>Like most aspects of information technology and engineering, automation of cybersecurity is a very likely possibility for the future of this technology. A key aspect of this will be the ever evolving abilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The main issue that employees tasked with protecting a network face is the volume of attacks that a business might face daily, and this can become overwhelming for one or even many people trying to constantly defend against these automated attacks. The detection of threats before they happen will be the future of cybersecurity especially threats that haven’t actually happened yet.</p>
								<p>The impacts of implementing AI and machine learning into cybersecurity to automate some aspects are pretty substantial in terms of minimising human effort. The amount of effort required for a network security department to manually skim through network logs and alerts could be manageable if they didn’t have very much in the way of network infrastructure, but when you get to huge companies like google, amazon or even military grade networks it would almost be impossible to stop all the cyber attacks that occur manually. In addition to this, the tolerance for discovering a possible threat and then trying to stop the attack before it was complete would be very small. Most of the time, if a new kind of cyber attack was discovered it might be after the attack has already successfully occurred, leading to the business having to invest their time into damage control to try and discover what data was stolen or what the ramifications of this breach could mean for their company.</p>
								<p>The market for cybersecurity is growing rapidly, a post by Forbes estimates that the current cybersecurity market is worth “173B in 2020” and suggests that it might grow “to 270B by 2026” (Columbus p9 2020). In addition to this, the U.S bureau of statistics estimates that the job market for positions such as information security analysts will increase by 31% between 2019 to 2029 while SEEK estimates job growth of 18% for the same position over the next five years. From these statistics, it’s clear to see that the cybersecurity industry is growing rapidly and will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, an information security analyst is only one kind job in the cybersecurity industry; other types of jobs in cybersecurity can be  programming, infrastructure, security engineers and much more.</p>
								<p>The effects that cybersecurity will have on an everyday user’s life are huge and are felt almost every day and it’s becoming easier for an everyday user to implement cybersecurity into their lives. The ramifications of cyber attacks for an end user could be devastating to their lives, whether that is a personal information leaked for public viewing or their personal data is stolen and used by someone else.This is also true if a user were to access a network that doesn’t have adequate network security or entrust their personal details to a business that doesn’t protect their assets well enough, or are ethically compromised and sell customer data to ad companies for profit could lead to some serious consequences for a user in the future.</p>
								<p>The reason why I’m so focused on the end-user in this context is because they are everyday people like me that are trying to make it in this ever changing world of the internet and being constantly connected to some sort of network. Luckily for the end-users, there are always ways that you can protect yourself and your privacy while browsing the internet and connecting to networks. Simple methods such as: not clicking on strange links or opening foregin emails, using strong passwords that include a mixture of numbers, lower and upper case letters and symbols, using two-factor authentication, avoiding using unsecure wifis and using virtual private networks can all be ways an end-user like RMIT students can employ simple network security methods to keep online browsing safe.</p>
								<p>With services and businesses quickly going online, it is so important for an end-user like myself and my family to protect themselves online from malicious and nefarious cyber attacks that prey on the naivety of users. In addition to this, it is crucially important that when an end-user can’t control the level of cybersecurity used, like when they access everyday services such as online banking, the security of the end-users that use the product or service is held to high regard by the company, because many people put their trust in a service to deliver a safe and stress free experience for their customers.</p>
