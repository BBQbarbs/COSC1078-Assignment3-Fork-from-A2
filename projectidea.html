								For this project, we aim to create a mobile application for iOS devices that, upon completion, will serve to help Victorians better navigate their way around the law and justice system. This application will thus have a twofold purpose:
							</p>
							<li>
								To aggregate different legal services available within Victoria.
							</li>
							<p>
								Given the wide range of avenues through which Victorians can ask for legal assistance, it may be intimidating to know where to start. Additionally, people may not know that other such alternatives exist, and believe that the most expensive option is the only one available. To combat both of these scenarios, the app will primarily focus on centralising the main sources of legal assistance: community legal centres, Victoria Legal Aid, Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, and lawyers/law firms.
							</p>

							<li>
								To provide general resources for Victorians to learn about and understand the law, regardless of what language they speak.
							</li>
							<p>
								The law is complex and comprehensive, often written in ways that make it difficult for people to understand without the legal know-how to parse the jargon. Those who can’t speak the language are even more so at a disadvantage. As such, the app’s secondary focus will be providing resources in plain English that can be understood by all Victorians, as well as having those same resources (where possible) be translated in a multitude of different languages. A feature where users can ask questions about the law, which will be answered by qualified lawyers/legal professionals, will also be added to enhance the informative aspect of the app. Additionally, interpreters and interpreting services are essential when it comes to helping those unable to speak English effectively navigate the law, and this app will provide space for those services to be accessed.
							</p>

							<hr>

							<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

							<p>The law and justice system should be impartial. To achieve this, everyone should have access to it and be judged fairly in the court of law. The legal system only works when everyone is informed of the law and their rights, and understands how the law is implemented and upheld. Given that we live in a capitalist society with no limit to monetary gain, obtaining legal representation has become very costly, and high quality representation is very much available only to those who can afford it.</p>

							<p>Considering the state of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52951093" target="_blank">America and the protests</a> happening across the country, as well as the persisting divisions that are reinforced by the <a href="https://www.alrc.gov.au/publication/pathways-to-justice-inquiry-into-the-incarceration-rate-of-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples-alrc-report-133/3-incidence/over-representation/" target="_blank">over-representation of Indigenous peoples in Australia</a>, there is a clear divide between law enforcers and the people they should be protecting. A problem lies with law enforcers who are exploiting the law for their own gain and individuals who aren’t fully informed of the law to properly protect themselves from such exploitations.</p>

							<p>As humanity as a whole is becoming a much more technologically advanced society, where information about these topics should be easily accessible to the masses, using technology will be instrumental in removing the factors that hinder people from accessing the justice system, particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged Victorians.</p>

							<p>Having a free mobile application that anyone can install onto their phones means that legal services can be easily delivered to those who would best benefit from it, but perhaps may not be able to access them due to factors such as:
								<ul>
									<li>being unable to afford private legal representation</li>
									<li>living in rural areas where legal resources are limited</li>
									<li>not knowing where to look for legal advice, not being able to consult someone for legal advice, or not being able to understand legal advice given</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p>As such, we hope this mobile application proves particularly beneficial to Victorians affected by these factors.</p>

								The project was initially Belle’s personal project idea, which was something that was inspired by Belle’s recent completion of a Criminology/Law & Justice focused degree, and was furthered by Belle’s current career as a transcriptionist for Victoria Police. Accessibility (and lack thereof) of the law and justice system, specifically the courts, was something she studied extensively, and how the paradigms of injustice are reinforced because people:</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
								<li>could not physically access justice</li>
								<li>could not monetarily afford justice</li>
								<li>could not understand the law because it was written in a way that not everyone can understand</li>
								</ul>
							<p>
								Belle spent most of Assignment 1 brainstorming ways through which technology could address these above barriers, and settled on a mobile application because it was something that could easily slide legal knowledge into the pockets of many. In Assignment 2, the group selected to build upon this project idea given how plausible it was to accomplish compared to the other group members’ idea. The group furthered upon the work completed by Belle in Assignment 1, expanding upon the motivations of the project to define the tenet of the application: empowering disadvantaged Victorians. Assignment 2 was also when new features were added in light of this, as well as a deeper exploration of the team’s IT skill set to execute and complete this project.
						</p>
						<h3>How has it progressed?</h3>
						<p>
							The development of Goony’s legal aid application has followed the intended aim and scope of the project that was discussed at the planning stage of this project. The scope of our project has limited us to creating a working user interface that will base the continuation of the project for the next 10 weeks of development.
						</p>
						<p>
							We started by breaking down the project into a series of functional requirements that would assist Goony in delivering their intended aim of providing a legal aid service to people who may not have knowledge in or don't have resources to access legal services elsewhere.

							The features that Goony settled on were:
						</p>
						<p>
						<ol>
							<li>Map screen with community legal centre locations (including a search function )</li>
							<li>Victoria Legal Aid (VLA) information</li>
							<li>Staff login (for VLA staff, law firm staff/lawyers etc.)</li>
							<li>Law firm directory/search (by area of specialisation, location, pro bono, etc)</li>
							<li>Law firm directory posting for each firm (contact details, status, website etc.). This will include back end functionalities (thanks to a database) which will allow this posting to be edited/updated by their respective law firm/lawyer</li>
							<li>A “library” of other law resources, including: A Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service section; Plain English Legal information (articles/informative videos, etc); Resources translated into languages other than English, as well as links to various interpreter services; An “Ask a Lawyer” function</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Once we settled on a series of functional requirements for the application, Goony then moved on to creating mock-ups of the user interface. Creating a user interface for an application requires the integration of the intended functional requirements in a way that promotes usability of the application. Using a series of standardised design principles in tandem with Nielson’s heuristics we started to mock-up some ideas for the user interface.
						</p>

						<h4>Consistency and Standards</h4>
						<p>
							It’s important for an interface to have consistency in its functionality. The Find a Lawyer/Law Firm features and the Find a Community Center were thus designed to have similar functions.
							</p>

							<img src="images/consistencyandstandards.png" alt="Consistency and Standards" class="center">
							<br>


						<h4>Prominence</h4>
						<p>
							It’s important for users to have their eyes drawn to what we deem as important features of the application. Our Victorian Aboriginal Legal service section demonstrates this principle by having the users eyes drawn to the VALS hotline.
							</p>

						<img src="images/prominence.png" alt="Prominence" class="center">
						<br>


						<h4>Aesthetics and Minimalist Design</h4>
						<p>
							The below wireframe drafts shows initial versions of our homepage and Victorian Legal Aid section, which reflects the heuristic of minimalist design by only having the important features of our application on the homepage.
							</p>

							<img src="images/aesthetics andminimalistdesign.png" alt="Aesthetics and Minimalist Design" class="center">
							<br>


						<h4>Match Between System and the Real World</h4>
						<p>
							It’s important as a user to be able to understand functionality of an application quickly without much effort. With this in mind, Google Maps was implemented as a navigation system, which allows users to find locations and directions to law firms or CLCs on our applications.
						</p>
							<img src="images/systemrealworld.png" alt="Match Between System and the Real World" class="center" class="center">
							<br>


						<p>
							After several mock-ups of the user interface, Belle moved on to developing the <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/SCwiOtEvUmZPEdsNTMqH1I/Legal-Services-UI-v2.?node-id=49%3A1097&scaling=scale-down"target="_blank">final prototype</a> of the user interface in Figma. The final prototype works as a fully functional display of what the user interface will look like in the finished mobile application, and abides by the same design heuristics and principles.
						</p>

						<h3>What stage of the plan are you up to?</h3>


						<h3>Dead-ends included</h3>


						<h3>Decisions made</h3>
						<p>
							We decided following Assignment 2 to change our method of task allocation - from dividing by marks on the rubric to taking a more collaborative approach, and each contributing to every task together. This led us to decide to use the Kanban tool to distribute our individual workloads across all of the tasks. On reflection we didn’t really take advantage of the Kanban tool specifically; but we did speak in team meetings about what we should focus and work on before the following meeting, and relied on individual team members' initiative to collaboratively contribute to those tasks.
						</p>
						<p>
							We also changed our initial project choice from a virtual assistant to a legal aid app. This decision was made largely due to limitations in our group's technical knowledge and experience, which limited the feasibility of us creating such an app as an artifact. We decided to go with the legal aid app because it would give us all an opportunity to cover several aspects of project development, instead of spending the majority of our time trying to learn how to code, which might have limited the scope of what we would learn from the assignment.
						</p>
						<p>
							We decided to create the UI prototype exclusively for IOS, in order to save time on creating an android version as well. This was largely for the same reasons as outlined in the previous point - that we wanted to maximise our available time on looking at different aspects of the assignment, rather than dedicating time to essentially duplicating one part.
						</p>
						<p>
							A major decision we came to in week 10/11 was how to proceed with our project, given we were ahead of schedule. Our main artifact was intended to be the Figma prototype of the app, but we had nearly finished that, and finished most of the report content as well, as of week 11. We discussed with Anthony in our consultation whether we should focus on deepening what we had already chosen to do - i.e. really consolidate the prototype as a high fidelity one with all the features we had chosen, and possibly add more - or broaden the scope and include other artifacts such as beginning on a SQLite database, Xamarin coding, etc. We ended up taking somewhat of a middle approach, in which we incorporated additional elements (including a relational database file and entity relationship diagram), but kept our primary focus on finishing the prototype, updating our forked github page with new content, and planning out our group video presentation (which we had somewhat forgotten about).
