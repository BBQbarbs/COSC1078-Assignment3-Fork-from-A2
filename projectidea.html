							<p>In the same vein as similar initiatives (such as the <a href="https://www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au/get-legal-help/legal-aid-nsw-app" target="_blank">Legal Aid NSW application</a> and the <a href="https://www.gotocourt.com.au/legal-news/legal-advice-app/" target="_blank">Go To Court application</a>) that aim to close gaps in accessing justice, our project will be the creation of a mobile application that focuses on aggregating different legal services available within Victoria, as well as providing general resources for Victorians to learn about the law. In order to achieve this, <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin" target="_blank">Xamarin</a>, an open source tool, will be used to create a mobile application that will work on both iOS and Android devices. Successfully completing this project will result in an easily accessible mobile application that places legal assistance and guidance in the pockets of Victorians, reducing the barriers that people (especially disadvantaged Victorians) face when it comes to navigating the justice system.</p>

							<hr>

							<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

							<p>The law and justice system should be impartial. To achieve this, everyone should have access to it and be judged fairly in the court of law. The legal system only works when everyone is informed of the law and their rights, and understands how the law is implemented and upheld. Given that we live in a capitalist society with no limit to monetary gain, obtaining legal representation has become very costly, and high quality representation is very much available only to those who can afford it.</p>

							<p>Considering the state of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52951093" target="_blank">America and the protests</a> happening across the country, as well as the persisting divisions that are reinforced by the <a href="https://www.alrc.gov.au/publication/pathways-to-justice-inquiry-into-the-incarceration-rate-of-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples-alrc-report-133/3-incidence/over-representation/" target="_blank">over-representation of Indigenous peoples in Australia</a>, there is a clear divide between law enforcers and the people they should be protecting. A problem lies with law enforcers who are exploiting the law for their own gain and individuals who aren’t fully informed of the law to properly protect themselves from such exploitations.</p>

							<p>As humanity as a whole is becoming a much more technologically advanced society, where information about these topics should be easily accessible to the masses, using technology will be instrumental in removing the factors that hinder people from accessing the justice system, particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged Victorians.</p>

							<p>Having a free mobile application that anyone can install onto their phones means that legal services can be easily delivered to those who would best benefit from it, but perhaps may not be able to access them due to factors such as:
								<ul>
									<li>being unable to afford private legal representation</li>
									<li>living in rural areas where legal resources are limited</li>
									<li>not knowing where to look for legal advice, not being able to consult someone for legal advice, or not being able to understand legal advice given</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p>As such, we hope this mobile application proves particularly beneficial to Victorians affected by these factors.</p>

							<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
							<p>This mobile application will place different legal service providers, as well as being a resource for accessing general information about Victorian law, in one central place. As such, the features of the application include:</p>

							<b><i>Allowing users to find a community legal centre (CLC) near them:</i></b>
							<ul>
								<li>This will involve being able to enter in a user’s location (using either a phone’s GPS functions or inputting in a location manually), where the contact details, the address and directions to CLCs near them (using something like Google Maps) will be displayed.</li>
								<li>Users can tap on a CLC’s hyperlinked phone number to call them directly from their mobile phone, or be able to use Google Maps to direct them to the CLC in real time.</li>
							</ul>

							<b><i>A dedicated section for <a href="https://www.legalaid.vic.gov.au/" target="_blank">Victoria Legal Aid</a> and its resources:</i></b>
							<ul>
								<li>Users can call-in directly to Victoria Legal Aid’s phone services to get legal advice by clicking on hyperlinked numbers.</li>
								<li>On the app itself, users can apply for lawyers that can represent them at court as well as facilitating applications for grants to help them afford legal representation. Easily shareable links and important documents will also be provided should the user prefer to do so on desktop, but have had little success in finding the information they need to do so themselves.</li>
								<li>Users can also locate and contact a Victoria Legal Aid office near them. Much like the CLC function, users can find a Victoria Legal Aid office by inputting in a location or through their phone’s GPS, and be given the office’s address and contact details.</li>
							</ul>

							<b><i>A directory of lawyers and law firms that can be filtered to show the services that are relevant to the user’s needs. The directory will work as follows:</i></b>
							<ul>
								<li>Each listing for a lawyer or law firm will show what area of law they specialise in, the locations their service covers, their contact details, an email address/a link to their website, whether they offer pro-bono services or solely a private practice etc.</li>
								<li>The directory can be filtered to show only what the user is looking for. For example, if the user is only looking for pro-bono lawyers and law firms associated with them, only those listings will show up. Similarly, the user could also be looking for lawyers and law firms near them.</li>
								<li>The directory can be easily updated to show the status of each lawyer or law firm and whether they’re available to take on more clients, whether they’ve expanded the areas of law they cover, etc.</li>
							</ul>

							<b><i>A dedicated section for the <a href="http://vals.org.au/" target="_blank">Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service (VALS)</a> for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples:</b></i>
							<ul>
								<li>This feature will provide easy access to VALS’s 24-hour hotlines by hyperlinking their numbers, as well as other important contact details and addresses.</li>
								<li>There will also be general information about VALS and what their service does for the Indigenous community.</li>
							</ul>

							<b><i>A general repository for users to learn more about the law, in plain English:</b></i>
							<ul>
								<li>This can include more in-depth looks at the legal issues that people commonly encounter throughout their lives (like speeding tickets) and the process that's undergone when dealing with them, and the sanctions associated with them.</li>
								<li>This can also include insights as to your rights as a Victorian, such as your rights when it comes to dealing with police.</li>
								<li>The repository can support content presented in both text form and in video forms. The text and contents of the video will be written in plain English and stripped of unnecessary legal jargon so it can easily be understood by all.</li>
							</ul>

							<b><i>A feature to improve accessibility via translated resources of important legal information, as well as a directory of interpreters/interpreting services that can assist individuals:</b></i>
							<ul>
								<li>Where possible, the resources found in the plain English repository will be translated in the most prominent languages spoken by Victorians.</li>
								<li>Much like the directory of lawyers and law firms, a directory specifically for accessing interpreters and interpreting services dedicated to working in the legal sphere will be provided. Each listing will detail the name of the interpreter/interpreting service, their contact details, an email address/website, and the languages they’re able to speak and translate.</li>
							</ul>
							<b><i>An inquiry feature where users of the app can send queries regarding legal topics that are of interest to them and would like to know more about legal practitioners or other legal experts who can answer them:</b></i>
							<ul>
								<li>The queries will not be answered in a rush to ensure accuracy and be of a high quality, but will be answered in due time.</li>
								<li>Users will input an email address where a response can be sent to. After typing out and sending a query, it sends an email confirming that their query has been received.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2 id="toolsandtechnologies">Tools and Technologies</h2>
							<p>As we intend to make an application that works for both iOS and Android devices, a tool that facilitates cross-platform development is essential. For this purpose, we’ve chosen <a href"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin" target="_blank">Xamarin</a>, an open source tool that combines C# and .NET to create applications for the OS of your choice. We would require a desktop through which we can run Xamarin and begin creating the application, as well as having an iOS device and an Android device so we can test the application in the future.</p>

							<hr>

							<h2 id="skillsrequired">Skills Required</h2>
							<p>Acquiring the software and hardware for this project, notably installing and running the necessary programs like <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>, <a href"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" target="_blank">Xcode</a> and SDKs on my desktop, is quite straightforward and feasible.The more difficult portion, however, is learning how to use these resources to make a functional mobile application. As our team is new to programming and have limited IT experience, this will prove to be a challenging learning experience for us. Though <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin" target="_blank">Xamarin</a> seems to have many tutorials for beginners and provides extensive support, we would still need to write the coding behind the application. As such, we think it would be beneficial to have some familiarity with C# and .NET, which is feasible, but will certainly take some time to achieve.</p>

							<hr>

							<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>
							<p>To summarise and re-iterate, if we expect the law to be respected by everyone, then the law should be accessible and available to everyone, not just the privileged and the rich.</p>
							<p>Socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals and communities lack access to the materials and resources necessary to let them participate fairly in the justice system, further isolating disadvantaged individuals and communities from getting the legal support they may need if they feel as if the law doesn't even care about them.</p>
							<p>If ignorance of the law cannot be used as an excuse, then it is important that steps are taken to make sure that everyone is informed of the law. It is the justice system's responsibility and within their best interest to ensure that everyone is well informed and educated about the law and the system that serves to protect them. If people understand the legal consequences of their actions, they are better able to uphold and respect the laws they must abide by, and feel less inclined to believe that they were sanctioned for an arbitrary reason if they did something wrong.</p>
							<p>If this project is successful, the end result is a mobile application that extends the precedent for mobile-based legal resources to Victoria. With this application, we hope that the barriers to justice that Victorians face are dissolved because these legal services, advice and resources fit neatly in their pockets at no cost to them to access. The success of this project will inspire others to utilise technology to lift up and help others so that they too may be treated fairly in the eyes of the law, and exercise the rights afforded to all.</p>
