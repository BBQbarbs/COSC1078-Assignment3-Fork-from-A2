							<p> Kohen Grogan is the Founder and Managing Director of the <a href="https://www.yappy.com.au/"Yappy Group</a>, a social media marketing company based in Perth, Western Australia. After completing a Bachelor of Communications in 2009, he worked briefly as an online reputation management and social media strategy consultant. During this period, he was constantly asked by clients about what the return on investment was for social media advertising. From their clear unfamiliarity with an emerging market, he saw an opportunity to fill a niche.</p>
							<p>Thus, in March 2012, he quit his job and created Yappy in his garage; his $2,000 savings constituting the budget <a href="https://alumniprofiles.ecu.edu.au/4282004-kohen-grogan"(Edith Cowan University, 2018)</a>. His aim was to create a platform that would be able to ‘accurately measure the effectiveness of clients’ social media marketing’ <a href="https://www.40under40.com.au/Winner/Kohen-Grogan#:~:text=Kohen%20Grogan%20founded%20Yappy%20Group,including%20Thermomix%2C%20Finbar%20and%20McDonald's"(40under40, 2016)</a>. The platform he created allows ‘users to set up and manage campaigns, harvest databases and track conversions from content across any platform on the social web’ <a href="https://thewest.com.au/business/finance/software-success-makes-yappy-talk-of-town-ng-ya-228122"(Hatch, 2015)</a>.</p>
							<p>Within the space of a few months, Yappy had moved from the garage to a St George’s Terrace office in the Perth CBD, and by 2020 it had become a multi-million dollar business that employed over 15 people and counted among its clients multinational companies such as McDonalds, Finbar and Thermomix.</p>
							<p>Kohen was kind enough to speak with us about his experiences, and offered some valuable insights into the tech sector.</p>
