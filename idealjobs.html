				<p>Although the group of six are all interested in the IT industry, there is not a common career path we share. Elements that are common within each ideal job is that we are expecting to use technology in the day-to-day operations of our
					jobs. The IT knowledge we obtain from this course will be used to increase our work experience in the future. Several of our current jobs have been impacted by the global pandemic which has given us the opportunity to study once again to
					enhance their current skill sets.</p>
				<p>The job requirements in our ideal jobs revolve around the compulsory requirement of a completed IT course or other degrees with the voluntary completion of an IT course. Given current circumstances, we all expect it will be difficult to
					find a suitable role and look for a low tier job or internship to start our journey.</p>
				<p>We all have significant differences in each role. We have ideal jobs in accounting, IT and even law, however we all have a good understanding of the roadmap to our final career path. There are also common aspirations to work in a large
					firm, although all different, we appreciate the status that comes with these companies. Larger companies also allow for greater opportunities, such as for Campbell’s desire to develop a game. This differentiates from Andrew’s goal as he
					aims to start his own firm one day.</p>
				<p>Across the group, we are quite diverse and are unlikely to work in the same field, however we could still work together and keep in contact with each other and use our expertise in our respective fields to collaborate on a project in the
					future.</p>
</br>

						<h1 class="major">Career Plans</h1>
	   		<p>The ideal jobs vary among the whole group. Since assignments 1 and 2, none of the group's career plans or ideal jobs have changed. However,
				 we all collectively agree that this course has contributed in guiding us to the correct direction. Our plans remain the same, but we have
				 developed skills and experiences that will benefit our careers. No two jobs are exactly the same and therefore the group have outlined
				 points regarding their career plan and ideal job. Our ideal jobs vary quite differently but some have similar career plans such as to
				 complete a bachelor’s degree. </p>
</br>
				<p> <b>Belle’s career plans:</b> </p>
				<p>Since assignment 1 and 2, the career plan has not changed too much in the sense that she’d like to pursue a career that combines two
					fields of interest for her, with the primary one being of a legal nature.Her ideal job, which was already a hybrid of the legal sector
					and IT, has not changed much as a result, as her interest in IT was greatly renewed thanks to taking this short course. </P>
