							<p> <b>Top IT Job Titles (Feb 2018)</b> </p>

							<p>Based on a research study by Burning Glass Technologies, we are able to rank the job titles based on their information gathered
								 from the US population. Although this was a US study, their global trends usually have high similarity to the Australian economy.
								 From the job roles studied, they broke them down to the following 5 categories; flagship jobs, fast-growing jobs, high-growth jobs,
								  modest-growth jobs and declining jobs.
									The study had also broken down all jobs into 7 groups: </p>
									<p>
										<ul>
										<li>Business</li>
										<li>Construction and Transportation</li>
										<li>Digital</li>
										<li>Health Care</li>
										<li>Science, engineering, and manufacturing</li>
										<li>Social services, personal services, and education</li>
										<li>Other</li>
										</ul>
								The majority of the group’s ideal jobs would be placed in the digital group. Although not the exact ideal job being advertised,
								the digital group has quite a high demand in online job postings, similarly to business jobs which is relevant for Andrew. Using
								data gathered from Burning Glass Technologies’ Job Title (February 2018), a developer programmer has a significantly higher amount
								of postings compared to the rest of the jobs available. The group’s ideal jobs are also in the field of systems engineer which is
								also high in demand. There are also help desk officers included in the study, however do not have as much demand as the others. In
								regards to Andrew’s ideal job of a tax accountant, demand has been stable and does not seem to be trending downwards, this is due to
								the fact that there will always be taxes and assistance in that field will be required. As for the digital industry, it is expected
								that the demand of their jobs will continue to grow as technology advances.</p>

								<p> <b>Top IT Skills (March 2018)</b> </p>

							</br>
							<p> Although our jobs will require information technology, our jobs are not dependent on the highest three skill sets - SQL, Javascript
								and Java. The IT specific skills required involve many from Microsoft Windows onwards (based on March 2018). As per our group’s IT
								skills, we have experience or working on the experience of what is required and could soon have many more IT required skills. The
								skills required for our ideal job industries do revolve around some of the IT requirements, however we are expected to learn these
								skills on the way.</p>
